# MyDragDropComposeApp
Drag Drop Launcher in Compose
This project demonstrates how to implement drag-and-drop functionality in Jetpack Compose.

Getting Started
To run the project, you will need to have the following installed:

Android Studio
The Jetpack Compose dependency
Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can open the project in Android Studio and run it.

Drag and Drop Functionality
The drag-and-drop functionality is implemented using the Draggable and Droppable composables. The Draggable composable allows you to drag an item around the screen, and the Droppable composable allows you to drop an item onto another item.

In this project, the drag-and-drop functionality is used to launch apps. When you drag an app icon, the icon will be displayed in a floating window. You can then drop the icon onto another app icon to launch the app.
